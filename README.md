# Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler

I CREATED  a div for each hour of time in the HTML page and assigned each one of them an ID.
I used the moment.js to display the present time on the page 

In the javaScript file, each hour of the day has a function to save the input text.

Every  hour of the day is being compared to the current hour of the user , this is accopmlished by using moment.js

There is if/else statment to set the appropriate colors  of each hour 

The past hours are gray and the user can't insert a task for it.

the current hour is red 

the future hours are green.
